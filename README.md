This project demonstrates a Hardhat use case to implement Question 3 from [Assignment 1](https://zku.one/assignments-final-project/assignment-1-into-the-woods) of [zku.ONE](https://zku.one). It comes with a main contract and a verifier contract, a test for that contract, a script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Run `npm i` to install.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npx hardhat help
```
